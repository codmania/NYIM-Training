Install "Homebrew" a package manager for OSX:
  > ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

After brew was installed, update all packages and install a MariaDB:
  > brew update
  > brew install mariadb

MariaDb is a drop in replacement for MySQL. But has more sane defaults and is much more performant. Run mariadb:
  > mysql.server start

Check out NYIM github repository to your local drive:
  > git clone git@github.com:3rdI/nyim.git

Go inside that folder and install add dependencies:
  > cd nyim
  > bundle install

If there will be any errors with installing mysql2 gem, you will need to install it manually:
  > gem install mysql2 --with-mysql-dir=/PATH/TO/MARIADB/

You need to provide proper path for mariadb, in my case it's (/usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/10.0.17). But you can find it out, by running:
  > brew info mariadb

After all gems are installed, you can easile setup database (create users and database itself) by running:
  > rake db:setup

Now you need to login to server and download latest backup. Latest one i found so fat is called 'nyim3_production.2013-07-05.sql'. I've used Transmit app to download it, you might use something else.

This is found on the server at:
  public_html/training-nyc.com/shared/backup

Assuming you put the backup file to 'bckp/' directory of nyim project. To apply it to your current database you need to run:
  > mysql -uroot -p[root_password] nyim3_production < bckp/nyim3_production.2013-07-05.sql

Now you have a back-up database running on your local machine which you can use to run queries on.


Backing up:
ssh root@207.210.201.229
mysqldump -uroot nyim3_production > "/root/nyim/shared/backup/dumpfile_$(date +"%m_%d_%Y").sql"

You need to connect to 'nyim3_production' database and this is query you could run (modify DATE range as needed):

select s.transaction_code, s.status,
  c.name as course_name,
  cg.name as group_name, cg.short_name as group_short_name,
  teacher.first_name as teacher_fn, teacher.last_name as teacher_ln,
  u.email as student_email, u.first_name as student_fn, u.last_name as student_ln,
  comp.name as student_company,
  sc.starts_at, sc.ends_at,
  s.os, s.created_at, s.updated_at, s.price
FROM signups s,
  courses c, scheduled_courses sc, users u, companies comp, users teacher, course_groups cg
WHERE s.course_id = c.id
  AND s.scheduled_course_id = sc.id
  AND s.student_id = u.id
  AND u.company_id = comp.id
  AND sc.teacher_id = teacher.id
  AND c.course_group_id = cg.id
  AND s.created_at > DATE('2015-04-14')
  AND s.created_at < DATE('2015-04-15');
